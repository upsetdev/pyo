# Managed by Pyo. Remove this file and restart k3s once k3s ships a
# containerd with the fix below.
#
# containerd's default container profile (contrib/apparmor/template.go in
# containerd v2.3.4, as bundled with k3s v1.36.5), with two lines added.
# On Ubuntu with kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_unconfined=1 and
# kernel 6.17+/7.0, container processes run under the stacked label
# "cri-containerd.apparmor.d//&unconfined", which the stock
# "peer=cri-containerd.apparmor.d" rules don't match: processes in the same
# container can't signal each other (Postgres, Go programs, CoreDNS hang).
# https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/14485
# https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/13625
#
# AppArmor loads this at boot, before k3s; containerd then keeps the
# loaded profile instead of generating its own.
